+ port build to graidl.(low)
+ switch on assert
+ start many zk on the same machine.
+ improve dependencies in hadoop pom xml 
+ master fail over by monitoring /katta/masters
D + name all indexes or indicies?
D + slaves listen to indexes and remove them in case they are gone..
D + if we have a notification for /something and list children for /something do we lose the notification than? 
D Do we might need to reniew it?
D + make sure in case one server has the same shard twice that it does not overwrites it.

D+ might be not such a good idea to sync against zk

+ would be cool to have query logs...
+ make query logs configurable.
+ we need a master fail over...
+ check syncronisation in slave...
+ gt Details.. for slave...
D !!!!+ we might want a folder that exists in the moment a index starts be fully deployed... used a flag...
+ shold we use mina and udp for query multicasting???
D + checken if this is a correct vindex by checking for shards in the folder...
+ !! we need to cleanup the local shard folder during start and clode down..
+ improve logging..
x add remove of shards from slave
x refactor the index structure in the test folder
x sort the result by score in the client
o if master starts again it doesn't know that it was the master
X compression
X decompression
o change compare order in our equal methods
o check parallel search with katta multi searcher
x check result lists for multithreading
x enable/disable logging

o change check for index deployment
o write status of slave and master to zookeeper
o show time how long it took to deploy an index...
o make event service may be as as inner class of client...
o port to latest zookeeper version!
o remove "/" with an constant in IPath
o should we have a custom shutdown hook?
o implement remove shard..
o do we need to start slave port listener on 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 ?
o set exception in slave in case one happens to be seen in SlaveMataData
o wrong shard assignment if index is still deployed - where hadoop got all shards - sg
o in HitsMapWritable we should only deal with String and convert to Text only if we serialize and back to lower the number of - merge with Hits - ms
x object instantiaten we do - ms
o the hit objects needs some major clean up - sg
o implement slave server test.. - sg
o remove all ThreadSleepMethods with joins for the given processes - sg
X checkout sdd post about lucene performance 
o could you skip df first roundtrip for single term queries? - ???
x client.search throws KattaException, KatteIOException to KattaException - ms
o test sort methode in Hits 
x in command line also show details when searching. - ms
X add IOExceptions for zkClient.
o clean up status updates in slave. - sg
o add support for warm up linux script... - ms
o use shardName everywhere and not key .. - sg
x add remove index.. - sg
x pass also query to selction plolicy so you can decide that you route a given query on a set of given notes. - sg
x add more java doc to slave and multisearcher. - sg
o test remove in slave test - sg
o use fastes sort... - sg
o use hadoop RPC parallel node calling
o block addIndex...
