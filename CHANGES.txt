katta 0.5
 fix KATTA-23, Parallize result detail retrieval
 fix KATTA-2, use the correct analyzer for queries. I used the opportunity here to depreciate IQuery and Query and switched it to lucene Query. 
 It is now possible to use any kind of lucene query created programatically. If you using a string you can use the lucene QueryParser. 
 The depreciate still uses the hardcoded KeywordAnalyzer.
 fix NPE in Node zookeeper reconnect in case the shardfolder was empty.  
 fix KATTA-4, shards are now searched in parallel with a thread pool, we still need to merge the results together though.
 fix KATTA-27, Query parser not  thread-safe.
 minor refactoring to make Node better testable without zookeeper.
 fix KATTA-10, add port to used shard folder so it is possible to start multiple nodes on one server
 fix KATTA-25, upgrading to zookeeper 3.1.1
 fix KATTA-20, Hits is now thread safe, because it is used by multiple searchers that are running concurrently to collect their results
